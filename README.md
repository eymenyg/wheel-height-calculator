# Wheel Height Calculator
Basic and simple C++ terminal program for calculating automotive wheel height

# Usage
Compile and run the program. The program will ask user input for tire width, sidewall aspect ratio, and rim diameter in inches, then it will calculate the wheel height based on the user input.

# Insight
A common way of representing modern tire sizes is XXX / YY R ZZ, where
XXX is the tire width in millimeters,
YY is the ratio of the tire sidewall to the tire width,
ZZ is the wheel diameter in inches,
and R denoting that this is a [radial tire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_tire).
